    have a troop put put troops into, or else the troops can't shoot.
  - 'Click here to start buying a tower. If you have enough gold, a tower image will
    appear. '
  - Placing it anywhere valid will place the tower, and charge you the gold.
  - After placing a tower, click on a troop in your inventory to highlight it. Then,
    click on the tower you want the troop to go into.
  - This will place the troop into the tower so it can start firing.
